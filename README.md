### Privet! My name is Poly / Paul / Pavel / Pasha from Russia 🚀

I’m an iOS developer, currently working as an iOS Engineer in [tutu.ru](tutu.ru) && developing personal projects. I'm slowly learning how to develop for the Android platform, but I can't brag about something yet.

- 🤓  Learning how to fix bugs fix bugs found by testers.
- 💬  Wanna relocate somethere from Russia (EU is my goal for my 25 y.o).
- 📫  How to reach me: Telegram: [@polykuzin](https://t.me/polykuzin) or just e-mail: polykuzin@gmail.com
- 🚴  Fun fact: I am an official by education, but I work as a programmer, and all because of a broken jaw (long-long story 😁)
